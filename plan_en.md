1. Defining Requirements
Functional Requirements:
Ability to authenticate a user via GitHub.
View user repositories.
Create, edit, and delete repositories.
View and manage issues and pull requests.
Non-functional Requirements:
Cross-platform.
Responsive and intuitive interface.
Data security.
2. Designing the Architecture
Modules:
UI (User Interface):
The main application window.
Forms for authentication and managing repositories.
Data visualization (lists of repositories, issues, etc.).
Network Layer:
Interaction with the GitHub API.
Processing HTTP requests and responses.
Business Logic:
Processing data received from the API.
Repository management logic, issues, and pull requests.
Data Model:
Classes for representing repositories, issues, pull requests, and users.
3. Development
Project setup:
Create a new project in an IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA).
Add JavaFX dependencies.
UI development:
Create FXML files to define the interface.
Write controllers to manage the interface logic.
Network layer development:
Use a library for HTTP requests (e.g. OkHttp).
Implement methods for authentication and interaction with the GitHub API.
Implement business logic:
Process data received from the API.
Implement methods for managing repositories, issues, and pull requests.
4. Testing
Unit testing:
Testing individual components (controllers, network layer, business logic).
Integration testing:
Testing interactions between components.
UI testing:
Checking the correctness of the display and interaction with the interface.
5. Documentation
Technical documentation:
Description of the system architecture and components.
Installation and configuration guide.
User documentation:
User guide.
Description of the functionality and capabilities of the application.
6. Deployment
Building the project:
Using build tools (such as Maven or Gradle).
Creating an executable file:
Packaging the application into a JAR file.
Deployment:
Distributing the application to users.
